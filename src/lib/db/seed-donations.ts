/**
 * Donation Seed Data Configuration
 * 
 * This file contains seed data configuration for demonstrating the missionary dashboard.
 * It defines realistic donation patterns across 13 months with three donation types:
 * - Recurring: Monthly automated donations from consistent supporters
 * - One-Time: Single online donations via Stripe
 * - Offline: Checks, cash, and wire transfers received offline
 * 
 * The data patterns reflect real missionary support scenarios:
 * - Year-end giving spike (November-December)
 * - Summer slowdown (June-August)
 * - New recurring donors acquired throughout the year
 * - Occasional large offline gifts
