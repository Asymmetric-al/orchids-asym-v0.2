# Teams & Permissions (Mission Control)

The Mission Control Dashboard features a professional-grade organizational management layer, allowing for granular control over user access and team collaboration.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Granular Permission Matrix
The permission system provides precise control over every module in Mission Control (CRM, Care, Contributions, etc.) using four distinct levels:
- **None**: No access to the module.
- **View**: Read-only access to module data.
- **Manage**: Ability to edit and create records within the module.
- **Admin**: Full administrative control over the module, including setting configurations.

### 2. Tab Integration
Permissions are tightly integrated with the `tiles` configuration. Every "tab" or "module" in the dashboard can be precisely controlled per team, ensuring that users only see and interact with the tools they are authorized to use.

### 3. Visual Indicators
- **ShieldCheck Icon**: Indicates Admin-level access.
- **Lock Icon**: Indicates restricted or "None" access.
- **Color-coded Badges**: Module previews in the team list show active permissions at a glance.

### 4. Advanced Team Management UI
The Teams page (`/mc/admin/teams`) uses a modern, high-fidelity interface:
- **Drill-Down Sheets**: Clicking "Manage" on a team opens a slide-over with a triple-tab surface:
    - **Permissions**: Configure the granular permission matrix for all modules.
    - **Members**: Manage team members, view roles, and handle invitations.
    - **Settings**: General team configuration and metadata.
- **Focused Profile Dropdown**: The profile dropdown has been refined (`w-64`) to focus on essential administrative routes.
