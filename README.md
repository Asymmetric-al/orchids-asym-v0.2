# Asymmetric.al - Kingdom Impact Platform

A high-performance, enterprise-grade Next.js 16.1 application for mission-focused organizations. Built for effortless impact with a sophisticated Zinc/Vega aesthetic.

## Architecture & Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16.1 (App Router, Turbopack) - *Optimized for Performance*
- **UI System**: Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui (Vega Style) + Radix UI
- **Theme**: Forced Light Zinc Aesthetic (Zinc/Zinc)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) + Prisma
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (Unified across platforms)
- **Payments**: Stripe (Advanced integration)
- **State Management**: React 19 + TanStack Query v5
- **Animations**: Framer Motion + Tailwind Motion

## UX/UI Standards (December 2025)

The platform follows a standardized **Zinc Light** theme, optimized for both desktop and mobile viewports with a seamless, responsive transition.

### Typography
- **Primary**: Inter (`tracking-tight`)
- **Mono**: Geist Mono
- **Headings**: Refined tracking and bold weight for clarity

### Design Tokens
- **Padding**: Standardized `px-4 py-6 sm:px-6` for main content areas.
- **Borders**: Subtle `zinc-200/60` borders with refined border-radius.
- **Motion**: Staggered reveals and smooth transitions using `MotionPreset`.
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first navigation with robust drawers (Sheet) for sidebar access on smaller screens.

### Chart Standards
- **Aesthetic**: Data-dense, high-contrast using `Zinc` and `oklch` color tokens.
- **Bar Charts**: 
  - **Radius**: Uniform corner radius of `[4, 4, 0, 0]` on the top segment of stacked bars or all segments of non-stacked bars. Avoid fully rounded "domed" tops.
  - **Density**: Use `maxBarSize={52}` for bold, wide bars that scale responsibly.
  - **Axes**: Ensure Y-Axis labels have sufficient width (min `40px`) and margin (`tickMargin={8}`) to prevent numerical cutoff.
  - **Labels**: Use `month` only for X-Axis time series (e.g., "Nov", "Dec") to maintain high density without clutter.

## Multi-Tenant Architecture & Routing

This platform is architected for a multi-tenant environment, allowing a single deployment to serve multiple organizations with isolated data and customized subdomains.

### Production Routing Model
In a live production environment, the platform uses dynamic routing based on host headers (subdomains):

| User Role | Production URL | Routing Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Public Site** | `tenanturl.org/` | Root application serving public content and giving pages. |
| **Organization Admin** | `tenanturl.org/admin` | Administrative interface for the organization (Mission Control). |
| **Missionaries/Workers** | `my.tenanturl.org` | Dedicated subdomain for field workers to manage their support and donors. |
| **Donors/Partners** | `tenanturl.org/dashboard` | Portal for donors to manage their contributions and pledges. |

### Demo Site Accessibility
For this demonstration and development environment, we have implemented aliases to allow easy access to all modules from a single domain:

- **Mission Control (Admin)**: Accessible via [/admin](/admin) (mapped to `/mc`)
- **Missionary Dashboard**: Accessible via [/my](/my) (mapped to `/missionary-dashboard`)
- **Donor Portal**: Accessible via [/dashboard](/dashboard) (mapped to `/donor-dashboard`)

### Implementation Details
- **Routing**: All routing logic, including demo aliases and production subdomains, is centralized in `src/proxy.ts` (Next.js 16 convention).
- **Proxy/Middleware**: The `src/proxy.ts` file uses the `updateSession` utility from `src/lib/supabase/proxy.ts` to manage authentication, session updates, and internal rewrites.
- **Conceptualization**: This architecture demonstrates how host-based routing isolates tenant context in production while providing path-based aliases for the demo environment.

## Project Modules

### Mission Control (MC)
The administrative headquarters for organization leaders. Manage CRM, Contributions, Member Care, and Mobilization with advanced reporting and automation tools.
- Route: `/mc`

### Missionary Dashboard
Empowering field missionaries with donor engagement tools, task management, and impact feeds.
- **My Feed**: A high-fidelity social engagement platform designed for missionaries to share their journey directly with their support base.
  - **Functionality**: Supports rich text (HTML) storytelling, multi-media carousels for multiple photos, and real-time interaction (Likes, Prayers, Comments).
  - **Premium Style**: Features a high-end "Vega" aesthetic with animated micro-interactions. Clicking a reaction triggers a delightful burst of floating emoji particles (❤️, 🙏, 🔥) and visceral pulsing effects.
  - **Workflow**: Missionaries can save drafts, manage visibility (Public vs Partners Only), and handle follower requests with manual or automated approval levels.
  - **Media Management**: Integrated media toolbar allows for quick image uploads and carousel creation to make updates visually engaging.
- Route: `/missionary-dashboard`

### Donor Portal
A seamless experience for kingdom partners to manage their giving and follow mission progress.
- **Personalized Impact Feed**: A unified, high-fidelity view of updates from all missionaries the donor supports.
- **The Connection Concept**: The platform creates a direct link between generosity and real-world impact. 
  - **Automatic Integration**: When a donor makes a contribution to a missionary or clicks "Follow" on their profile, that missionary's feed is automatically integrated into the donor's personalized dashboard.
  - **Real-Time Updates**: Donors receive instant access to stories, prayer requests, and progress reports, allowing them to see exactly how their partnership is making a difference.
  - **Two-Way Interaction**: Donors can respond with reactions and comments, fostering a genuine relationship between the field and the support base.
- Route: `/donor-dashboard`

## Development

**Package Manager**: This project uses **bun** (v1.3+). Do not use npm/yarn/pnpm.

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run development server (Turbopack enabled)
bun run dev

# Lint & Typecheck (Recommended before commit)
bun run lint && bun run typecheck

# Run E2E tests
bun run test:e2e
```

### Key Dependencies

| Package | Version | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Next.js | 16.1.1 | App Router + Turbopack |
| React | 19.2.3 | Concurrent features |
| TypeScript | 5.9.3 | Strict mode |
| motion | 12.x | Animation library (formerly framer-motion) |
| @tanstack/react-query | 5.x | Server state management |
| @supabase/ssr | 0.8.x | Server-side Supabase client |
| @sentry/nextjs | 10.x | Error monitoring |

### Verification Steps

```bash
# Full verification suite
bun run typecheck && bun run lint && bun run build

# Check for outdated packages
bun outdated
```

## Key Conventions

1. **RSC First**: Keep components as React Server Components unless interactivity is required.
2. **Next.js 16.1 Compliance**: Always `await` dynamic `params` and `searchParams` in routes and layouts.
3. **Zinc Aesthetic**: Use `zinc-900` for primary actions and `zinc-500` for secondary text.
4. **Responsive Integrity**: Test all UI changes on both 375px (Mobile) and 1440px (Desktop) viewports.
